# 🌐 Netlify Deployment - Alternative Approach

## 🚨 **Issue**: Netlify Auto-Detection Conflict

Netlify is detecting Python files in the repository and attempting to install Python dependencies, which conflicts with static frontend deployment.

## ✅ **RECOMMENDED SOLUTION: Manual Frontend Deployment**

Since Netlify is having trouble with the monorepo structure, here's the **guaranteed working approach**:

### **Option 1: Direct Frontend Upload (Recommended)**

1. **Download the frontend folder** from GitHub:
   ```
   https://github.com/davidosland-lab/GSMT-Ver-813/tree/main/frontend
   ```

2. **Drag and drop the `frontend/` folder** directly to Netlify:
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
   - Drag the entire `frontend/` folder 
   - Netlify will deploy it as a static site immediately

3. **Configure API URL**:
   - Open the deployed Netlify site
   - Click Settings (gear icon)
   - Enter your Railway backend URL
   - Save settings

### **Option 2: Create Separate Frontend Repository**

1. **Create a new repository** just for the frontend:
   ```bash
   # Create new repo: GSMT-Frontend
   git init GSMT-Frontend
   cd GSMT-Frontend
   ```

2. **Copy frontend files**:
   ```bash
   # Copy from main repository
   cp -r ../GSMT-Ver-813/frontend/* .
   ```

3. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Connect the frontend-only repository to Netlify
   - No Python detection conflicts

### **Option 3: GitHub Pages**

Alternative static hosting:
1. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
2. Set source to `frontend/` directory  
3. Access via: `https://davidosland-lab.github.io/GSMT-Ver-813/frontend/`
