• LSTM Model: 0% accuracy (CRITICAL BUG)
• Quantile Regression: 29.4% accuracy (BEST PERFORMER)
• Random Forest: 21.4% accuracy (OVERWEIGHTED)
• Confidence Calibration: 35.2% reliability (TARGET: 70%+)

🎯 IMPROVEMENT TARGETS:
• Phase 1 Target: 50%+ accuracy (fix critical bugs)
• Phase 2 Target: 65%+ accuracy (optimize architecture)  
• Phase 3 Target: 75%+ accuracy (advanced features)
• Phase 4 Target: Production-ready (robust, scalable, compliant)

📊 RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS:
• Total Effort: {total_hours} hours (~{total_hours//40} weeks full-time)
• Critical Path: {len(plan.get_critical_path())} high-priority tasks
• Dependencies: Careful sequencing required for success

🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (WEEK 1):
1. Fix LSTM implementation bug (0% accuracy unacceptable)
2. Implement performance-based weight adjustment  
3. Begin confidence calibration improvement
4. Start enhanced feature engineering pipeline

💰 SUCCESS METRICS:
• Phase 1: >50% accuracy (week 4 target)
• Phase 2: >65% accuracy (week 8 target) 
• Phase 3: >75% accuracy (week 12 target)
• Phase 4: Production deployment ready (week 16 target)

⚠️ RISK MITIGATION:
• Weekly accuracy validation checkpoints
• Rollback capability for failed improvements
• Parallel development of critical components
• Continuous backtesting validation

🎯 EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
Upon completion, the ensemble predictor will achieve:
• 75%+ directional accuracy consistently
• 70%+ confidence calibration reliability
• <1s inference time for real-time predictions
• Production-grade robustness and scalability
• Full regulatory compliance documentation

This plan transforms the current 23.7% accuracy system into a 
production-ready 75%+ accuracy ensemble suitable for real-world deployment.
